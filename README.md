# MySQL-Database

  This project represents a responsive authentication platform built with PHP, HTML, and CSS, designed to provide a seamless and secure user experience for both registration and login functionalities.
  The system operates on a local development environment powered by XAMPP, integrating Apache, PHP, and MySQL to facilitate efficient backend processing and database management through phpMyAdmin.

🧾 User Registration: Allows new users to register with their name, email, password, and user role (User/Admin).

🔐 Login Authentication: Validates user credentials securely using PHP’s built-in hashing functions.

🔄 Form Toggle Mechanism: JavaScript enables dynamic switching between the login and registration forms.

⚠️ Error Handling: Displays validation messages using PHP session variables.

🗄️ Database Integration: User information is persisted in a structured MySQL table for easy management.
